# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Classic Crossword Puzzle Game

## Quick Deploy to Netlify

### Option 1: Netlify CLI (Recommended)

The project is already configured with Netlify. Simply run:

```bash
# From the root directory
cd /Users/toby/Documents/react-crossword-fork

# Login to Netlify (if not already)
netlify login

# Build the example app
cd example
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
```

### Option 2: Netlify Dashboard

1. **Build the App**:

```bash
cd /Users/toby/Documents/react-crossword-fork/example
npm run build
```

2. **Upload to Netlify**:
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com
   - Drag and drop the `build` folder
   - Your site will be live immediately!

### Option 3: GitHub Integration

1. **Push to GitHub**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Enhanced crossword game with PWA features"
git push origin main
```

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose your repository
   - Build settings:
     - **Build command**: `cd example && npm install && npm run build`
     - **Publish directory**: `example/build`
   - Click "Deploy site"

## 📱 PWA Considerations

### HTTPS Required

PWA features (including service workers) require HTTPS. Netlify provides this automatically.

### Testing PWA Features

After deployment:

1. **Test Installation**:

   - Open your site in Chrome/Edge
   - Look for install icon in address bar
   - Click to install

2. **Test Offline**:

   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application > Service Workers
   - Check "Offline" checkbox
   - Refresh page - it should still work!

3. **Lighthouse Audit**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Lighthouse tab
   - Run audit
   - Should score 90+ for PWA

## 🔧 Environment Variables

If using Firebase features, add to Netlify:

1. Go to Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment
2. Add these variables (get from Firebase console):
   ```
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to Site Settings > Domain Management
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions
4. SSL will be auto-provisioned

## 📊 Performance Optimization

The build includes:

- ✅ Minified JavaScript
- ✅ Optimized CSS
- ✅ Tree-shaken dependencies
- ✅ Service worker caching
- ✅ Asset compression

Expected Lighthouse scores:

- **Performance**: 90-100
- **Accessibility**: 95-100
- **Best Practices**: 90-100
- **SEO**: 90-100
- **PWA**: 90-100

## 🔍 Testing Before Deploy

```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Test the production build
npx serve -s build

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Updating

```bash
# Clear service worker cache
# In browser DevTools:
# Application > Service Workers > Unregister
# Then hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
```

### Build Fails

```bash
# Clear node_modules and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### PWA Not Installing

- Ensure site is served over HTTPS
- Check manifest.json is accessible
- Verify service worker is registered
- Check browser console for errors
